  <h2>About this app</h2>
  <p>
    I made this little web app because I love trivia, and I wanted to be able to play no matter where I am. It's really
    easy to play, just select your category, and the number of questions you want, then press the "Get questions"
    button. That's all you need!

    This application is built using the free API provided by the <a href="https://opentdb.com">Open Trivia Database</a>.
    Information about the terms by which the questions and answers are provided can be found on their site.
